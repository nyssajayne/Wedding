# About
I married my husband in New York City in 2015, and then proceeded to host a party in his hometown of Chesterfield, UK, and one where we both lived in Melbourne, Australia.  That's three different guestlists which involved guests who may have been coming to one or more parties.  We mailed out regular paper-invitations, and then asked guests to log in to confirm their RSVP and any dietary requirements.

# On the Inside
Built on Wordpress, each guest was a user of the site (usually at a subscriber level).  A separate table in the MySQL database recorded which parties the guest was invited to and redirected them to the required pages.  The 'guest' login provided will show you all three parties, but some users were faced with just one party, in which case, they were directed straight to the correct page.

A custom theme, with a functions.php page, handles the logic.

# On the Outside
Each city has it's own theme.  The invitation for New York is based on the iconic subway signs, and is built entirely in CSS (it was retrofitted back to Illustrator for the paper invitations).

The Chesterfield theme is based on vintage football programs.  The party was at the local soccer club with a long history, so they served as a reference.

The Melbourne theme is based on the dive bars that populate the city (the background image is actually from a toilet stall in Cherry Bar).  Neon signs are becoming more and more common in these bars.

The overarching character present throughout is the flamingo -- he is based on the neon light flamingo that can be found at the Meredith Music Festival, a small indie festival that happens twice a year just outside of Melbourne.  An important part of our relationship, we also later found out that flamingos live for a very long time, so we enjoyed the additional aspect of longevity as well.
